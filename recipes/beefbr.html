    <ul><li>8 oz bag of soy curls</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 lb of broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 to 3 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of kitchen bouquet</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of kitchen bouquet </li>
        <li>3 tbsp of brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 tsp of red chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of grated ginger</li>
        <li>5 cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of cornstarch</li></ul>
    <h2>Optional Additions</h2>
        <ul><li>4-5 cups of white or brown rice</li>
        <li>chopped green onions</li>
        <li>sesame seeds</li>
        <li>additional chili flakes or hot sauce</li></ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol><li>In a large bowl, add the dehydrated soy curls, then cover with about 4 cups of hot 
        water. Let them rehydrate for about 10 minutes until they have grown in size and 
        softened. Drain in a colander and squeeze any excess water from the pieces.</li>
        <li>Using the same bowl (once empty), add the soy curls back to it, along with the 
            cornstarch and stir to coat. I use my hands to really coat the pieces as 
            much as possible. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the sauce: In a small-medium bowl, add all sauce ingredients and whisk 
            until the cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saut√© pan or wok, add the broccoli and 1/2 cup water. Turn the heat 
            to high, cover and steam the broccoli for about 2 minutes until bright green and 
            slightly softened. Then remove the broccoli to a plate nearby.</li>
        <li>To the empty pan, add 1-3 tablespoons of oil, then add the soy curls and fry, 
            stirring frequently for 4-5 minutes until a bit golden and crisp. I also like to 
            add a few tablespoons of kitchen bouquet while frying, which helps make the soy 
            curls nice and brown. Remove from the pan and set on a plate. You may omit the oil 
            if you have a very good non-stick pan, otherwise the soy curls will stick. Turn 
            the heat down to medium.</li>
        <li>Whisk the sauce once more, then add to the pan with the soy curls. Stir constantly 
            for a minute or two, until the sauce thickens, then add the broccoli back in and 
            stir. Serve immediately over rice topped with sesame seeds and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
