    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul><li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Instant yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>
        <li>Tempeh</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fennel seeds</li>
        <li>Dried basil</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li></ul>
    <h1>Steps for making the Dough</h1>
    <ol><li>To begin, add 1 cup of flour, yeast, sugar, and salt to a large bowl or 
            stand mixer. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Next, pour in the warm water and olive oil and stir well with a large spoon. </li>
        <li>Gradually add the rest of the flour, half a cup at a time, until the dough starts 
            to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>It should be a little sticky but not too wet to handle with your hands. The dough 
            will still be a little shaggy at this point.</li>
        <li>If you are using a stand mixer with a dough hook, knead the dough for 2 to 3 minutes. 
            If using your hands, transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 4 
            to 5 minutes. Do so until a cohesive ball is formed. </li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with oil and place the kneaded dough inside. Cover with a kitchen 
            towel and let the dough rise in a warm area for about 30 minutes or until it nearly 
            doubles in size. Tip: Preheat the oven to 300ºF, then turn it off and set the bowl 
            inside with the door slightly open.</li></ol>
    <h1>Steps for Cooking Sausage</h1>
        <ol><li>In a medium pan with a lid, crumble the tempeh and add a 1/2 cup of water. Steam, 
            covered for about 5 minutes until nearly all the water has evaporated. </li>
        <li>Next, add the olive oil and remaining ingredients to the pan and cook, stirring 
            frequently for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. </li></ol>
    <h1>Steps for Finishing the Pizza </h1>
        <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 450ºF.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, gently punch it with your fist so it deflates. 
            Transfer it to a floured surface and roll out with a rolling pin or your 
            hands until the dough fits your pizza pan. Fold over the edges to make a crust, 
            if desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to your pizza pan. Put the pizza together by adding a layer 
            of sauce, tempeh sausage, cheese, and more toppings as desired. Bake the pizza 
            for 12 to 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is 
            melted. Slice and serve!</li></ol>
